                        Fried Chicken
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken
                        pieces
                        that have been coated
                        with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The
                        breading
                        adds a crisp coating
                        or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are
                        most commonly used.

                        The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European
                        Middle
                        Ages. However, it
                        was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without
                        seasoning). Meanwhile,
                        many West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking
                        the
                        chicken in palm
                        oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved
                        Africans and
                        African-Americans in the American South.

                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been
                        eating
                        beef since
                        prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.

                        Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or
                        steak
                        (filet mignon,
                        sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are
                        processed
                        (corned beef or
                        beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, which are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner
                        (therefore tougher)
                        cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood
                        sausage. Other parts
                        that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from
                        the
                        reticulum or rumen,

                        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared
                        vinegared
                        rice (鮨飯,
                        sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ,
                        neta),
                        such
                        as seafood, often
                        raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
                        ingredient is
                        "sushi rice", also
                        referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).

                        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with
                        brown
                        rice
                        or
                        short-grain rice.
                        It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
                        imitation
                        crab
                        meat. Many types
                        of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy
                        sauce.
                        Daikon
                        radish or pickled
                        daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

                        Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists
                        of
                        thinly
                        sliced raw fish or
                        occasionally meat.
